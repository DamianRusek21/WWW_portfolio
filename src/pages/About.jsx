        <p>
          I am a Computer Science student at Kean University with a
          concentration in Data Science. My academic focus includes
          machine learning, predictive modeling, data engineering,
          and intelligent systems design.
        </p>

        <p>
          I have hands-on experience building end-to-end data projects,
          from data cleaning and feature engineering to model development,
          visualization, and dashboard deployment using Tableau.
        </p>

        <p>
          In addition to data science, I have DevOps experience working
          with Docker, Kubernetes, and CI/CD pipelines, where I supported
          reproducible deployment environments and documented workflows
          for instructional systems.
        </p>

        <p>
          I was recognized on the Dean’s List (Spring 2024 – Fall 2025)
          and am a member of the Phi Kappa Phi Honor Society, representing
          academic excellence within the top 7.5% of my class.
